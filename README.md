## Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames

### Category

  - A "category_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "cat1" to "catn", where n is the number of unique categories
  - A "category" column that contains only the category titles

The following image shows this category DataFrame:

  - A "subcategory_id" column that has entries going sequentially from "subcat1" to "subcatn", where n is the number of unique subcategories
